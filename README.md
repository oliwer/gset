# gset - A Set data structure using Go's generics

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/oliwer/gset.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oliwer/gset)

A `Set` is a list of unique items of the same type.

This is an extremely simple Set implementation based on a hash table. It is mutable and not thread-safe. Just a little execise to familiarise myself with Go generics.
